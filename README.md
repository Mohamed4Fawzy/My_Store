- Product details page, which displays more information about any particular product
- Shopping cart, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
- Checkout form, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
- Order confirmation page, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)
